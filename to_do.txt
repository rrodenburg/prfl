tensorboard --logdir 18 --host=127.0.0.1

To do / check
- DONE Create functions and lib for tensor flow network
- DONE Implement tensorboard
- Implement custom tensor board stats (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40722413/how-to-use-several-summary-collections-in-tensorflow)
	- Time per epoch
	- Played Q value
- Implement tensor board histograms
- DONE Implement prediction network and weight copy-ing
	- DONE create test code in ccn_test.py
- Design custom cnn with batch normalisation layers
- Create lib for reinf learning 
- check if code get slower with more epochs
	- DONE give dataset length to function, remove len()
	- check if code is also slow with very small dataset length
	- randomize dataset and select batch ranges
	- issue most likely due to tensor flow, all tensor flow functions get slower over time (action picking, update nn, copy network)

Add evaluation metric:
- DONE avg game length per epoch
- DONE avg score per epoch

Network is exploding during training:
- maybe due to recursiveness when creating y
- maybe add batch normalization?
- check learning rate

Problems to solve:
- NO PROBLEM some images miss a pad

Pong settings (quick training):
number_of_players = 1,
width = width, 
heigth = heigth, 
ball_radius = 2, 
pad_width = 4, 
pad_heigth = 14, 
pad_velocity = 8, 
pad_velocity_ai = 4,
DistPadWall = 4,
ball_velocity = 1.5)

(slow training, but able to catch first ball, exploding):
number_of_players = 1
width = width, 
heigth = heigth, 
ball_radius = 2, 
pad_width = 4, 
pad_heigth = 14, 
pad_velocity = 8, 
pad_velocity_ai = 2,
DistPadWall = 4,
ball_velocity = 0.7)
