To do / check
- DONE Create functions and libfor tensor flow network
- Implement tensorboard
- Design custom cnn with batch normalisation layers
- Create lib for reinf learning 

Add evaluation metric:
- avg game length

Network is exploding during training:
- maybe due to recursiveness when creating y
- maybe add batch normalization?
- check learning rate

Pong settings (quick training):
number_of_players = 1,
width = width, 
heigth = heigth, 
ball_radius = 2, 
pad_width = 4, 
pad_heigth = 14, 
pad_velocity = 8, 
pad_velocity_ai = 4,
DistPadWall = 4,
ball_velocity = 1.5)

(slow training, but able to catch first ball, exploding):
number_of_players = 1
width = width, 
heigth = heigth, 
ball_radius = 2, 
pad_width = 4, 
pad_heigth = 14, 
pad_velocity = 8, 
pad_velocity_ai = 2,
DistPadWall = 4,
ball_velocity = 0.7)
