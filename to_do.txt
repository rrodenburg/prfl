tensorboard --logdir 18 --host=127.0.0.1

To do / check
- DONE Create functions and lib for tensor flow network
- DONE Implement tensorboard
- Implement custom tensor board stats
- Implement tensor board histograms
- DONE Implement prediction network and weight copy-ing
	- DONE create test code in ccn_test.py
- Design custom cnn with batch normalisation layers
- Create lib for reinf learning 

Add evaluation metric:
- avg game length per epoch
- avg score per epoch

Network is exploding during training:
- maybe due to recursiveness when creating y
- maybe add batch normalization?
- check learning rate

Problems to solve:
- some images miss a pad

Pong settings (quick training):
number_of_players = 1,
width = width, 
heigth = heigth, 
ball_radius = 2, 
pad_width = 4, 
pad_heigth = 14, 
pad_velocity = 8, 
pad_velocity_ai = 4,
DistPadWall = 4,
ball_velocity = 1.5)

(slow training, but able to catch first ball, exploding):
number_of_players = 1
width = width, 
heigth = heigth, 
ball_radius = 2, 
pad_width = 4, 
pad_heigth = 14, 
pad_velocity = 8, 
pad_velocity_ai = 2,
DistPadWall = 4,
ball_velocity = 0.7)
